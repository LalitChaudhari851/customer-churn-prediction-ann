# Customer Churn Prediction using ANN

This project predicts customer churn (whether a customer will leave a service) using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built with TensorFlow/Keras.  
It’s a supervised classification problem that helps businesses identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to retain them.
